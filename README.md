  <p>👋🏽 Hey there, I'm Morris and I currently am a founder of <b>Astro Labs</b>. I've been working as a graphic designer for the past 3 years, and I taught myself everything I know. It hasn't always been easy - I've had to deal with long, stressful moments along the way. Before starting up Astro Labs, LLC, I owned a business called Morris Designs. Running my own business taught me how to work with clients and manage my own projects.</p>

<h2>My Journey 🏃🏽‍♂️</h2>

 <p>I started out as a graphic designer with a passion for creating beautiful designs. Over time, I learned more and more about design principles, tools and techniques. I've worked on a wide range of projects, like designing logos, visual fx, and a bit of website mockup designs.

Through my work as a designer, I've learned that good design isn't just about making things look pretty. It's about solving problems and helping clients achieve their goals.</p>
